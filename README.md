# Horiseon Refactoring Project

## Description

The project's objective was to refactor the Horiseon site so that: 
* the codebase follows accessibility standards
* the site is optimized for search engines

HTML code was restructured to incorporate the latest guidelines on 
<br>
the  use of semantic elements.

CSS code was reworked to make it more efficient by consolidating 
<br>
selectors and properties (where appropriate), organizing them to 
<br>
follow the revised structure of the HTML elements. 

Additionaly, comments were added to the HTML and CSS code to  
allow for readability and maintenance of the code.
